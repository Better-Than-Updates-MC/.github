<p align="center">
  A modding toolchain for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.<br>
  Because who needs Minecraft updates when you could have a stable modding environment?
</p>

Better Than Wolves is a jar mod for Minecraft, last updated for Minecraft 1.5.2,
which was last updated December 24th, 2020. It is now retired by the creator, FlowerChild.

Better Than Updates was started to provide better mod support for Better Than Wolves.

The original idea was to provide support for BTW on Minecraft 1.5.2,
but Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 has a far larger community and more potential for modding.

## Goals:
- Create libre mappings for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3's code with 100% coverage.
- Port all common legacy modding APIs to the Fabric toolchain
- Provide APIs one would need to make proper Minecraft mods
- Port Better Than Wolves to Fabric
- Support Better Than Wolves addons
- Backport every feature from the latest version of Better Than Wolves to Beta 1.7.3
